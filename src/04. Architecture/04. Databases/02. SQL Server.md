# SQL Server

> Please remember that if you're going to use our provided packages for ASP.NET Identity you will **also need need to include** the SQL Server package for Identity. For more information, please refer to article about using [Identity](../authentication/identity) for Piranha.

Whether you're using `SQL Express`, `SQL Server` or `SQL Azure` it's the same setup. SQL Server is a high performance database intended for production usage that can handle very high workloads.

## Installation

To use SQL Server you need to add the NuGet package for running Piranha with `Entity Framework Core` and `SQL Server`.

~~~ bash
PM> install-package Piranha.Data.EF.SQLServer
~~~

## Registering The DbContext

After you've made sure you have the package reference you need you simply specify that you want to use SQL Server **and** the connection information you want for your database in your `Startup.cs`. Add a new file `appsettings.json` to the root of your application. It's good practice to specify your connection string in your `appsettings.json` so you can have different connection strings for different environments.

~~~ json
{
    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "piranha": "Data Source=;Initial Catalog=;User Id=;Password=;MultipleActiveResultSets=True"
    }
}
~~~

When you've setup your configuration string you can access it from `ConfigureServices` in your `Startup.cs`.

~~~ csharp
using Piranha.Data.EF.SQLServer;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;

public class Startup
{
    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; private set; }

    public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        Configuration = configuration;
    }

    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        ...

        // Service setup
        services.AddPiranha(options =>
        {
            options.UseEF<SQLServerDb>(db =>
                db.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("piranha")));
        });

        ...
    }
}
~~~

That's it! You're now using SQL Server with Piranha.

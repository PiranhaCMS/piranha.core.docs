# SQLite

> Please remember that if you're going to use our provided packages for ASP.NET Identity you will **also need need to include** the SQLite package for Identity. For more information, please refer to article about using [Identity](../authentication/identity) for Piranha.

## Installation

To use SQLite you need to add the NuGet package for running Piranha with `Entity Framework Core` and `SQLite`.

~~~ bash
PM> install-package Piranha.Data.EF.SQLite
~~~

## Registering The DbContext

After you've made sure you have the package reference you need you simply specify that you want to use SQLite **and** the connection information you want for your database in your `Startup.cs`.

~~~ csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    ...

    // Service setup
    services.AddPiranha(options =>
    {
        options.UseEF<SQLiteDb>(db =>
            db.UseSqlite("Filename=./mydatabase.db"));
    });

    ...
}
~~~~

That's it! You're now using SQLite with Piranha.

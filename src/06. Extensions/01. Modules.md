# Modules

If you want to distribute a set of custom components, a good way to do it is to package them into a **Module**. In Piranha a module is really nothing more than a NuGet-package (or project if you're creating a module for your self) that supplies some extensions methods and registers a class implementing the `Piranha.Extend.IModule` interface.

If you have installed our project templates you can easily create a new module with the command `dotnet new piranha.module`. You can find the source code for the module template [here](https://github.com/PiranhaCMS/piranha.core.templates/tree/master/src/module).

## Benefits

So what's the differences between creating a module over just building a package containing classes and other components.

### Module Initialization

When `App.Init()` is called from Configure in `Startup.cs` all registered modules are initialized. If your code is dependent on other parts of the application being initialized, packaging it as a module **ensures** that your code is executed at the correct time, and not before the main Piranha App is ready.

### Visual Module Information

![Modules](../_assets/modules-list.png)

Packaging your components as a module also renders it in the **Module section** in the manager, where your users can see the currently installed version and get a link to the current package version. You can also present information about the module and maybe link to your website for more documentation.

## Creating The Module Project

You have two options when creating your module project. If you are going to embed view componets (`Razor Pages`, `MVC Views` etc) or static resources (`CSS`, `Javascript`) you should create your project as a `Razor Class Library`. This is a project that supports embedding these types of resources in an easy way.

If your module will only contains classes you can create it as a standard `Class Library` as you won't need the features of the Razor Class Library.

## The IModule Interface

In order to be registered in the Piranha App, all modules need to have a class that implement the `Piranha.Extend.IModule` interface.

~~~ csharp
public interface IModule
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Get the author for this module
    /// </summary>
    string Author { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Get the name of the module
    /// </summary>
    string Name { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Get the module version
    /// </summary>
    string Version { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Get the module description
    /// </summary>
    string Description { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Get the package url for the module
    /// </summary>
    string PackageUrl { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets the logo url for the module.
    /// </summary>
    string IconUrl { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Initializes the module.
    /// </summary>
    void Init();
}
~~~

As you can see, all of the Properties that needs to implemented has to do with how the module is presented in the manager interface. The `Init()` method is where you take care of the actual initialization of your module.

As the `Init()` method is called from `App.Init()` in the Configure method you need to make sure that module is registered before this. The best place to do it is from an extension method in `ConfigureServices()`.

## Example

As an example, let's say we'd like to create a module containing a single block and a Vue component to render it in the manager. This is what the code could look like for initializing the module.

##### Module.cs

~~~ csharp
using Piranha;
using Piranha.Extend;

namespace SimpleModule
{
    /// <summary>
    /// The identity module.
    /// </summary>
    public class Module : IModule
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Gets the Author
        /// </summary>
        public string Author => "Test Author";

        /// <summary>
        /// Gets the Name
        /// </summary>
        public string Name => "SimpleModule";

        /// <summary>
        /// Gets the Version
        /// </summary>
        public string Version => Piranha.Utils
            .GetAssemblyVersion(GetType().Assembly);

        /// <summary>
        /// Gets the description
        /// </summary>
        public string Description => "Simple Module";

        /// <summary>
        /// Gets the package url.
        /// </summary>
        public string PackageUrl => "https://www.nuget.org/packages/SimpleModule";

        /// <summary>
        /// Gets the icon url.
        /// </summary>
        public string IconUrl => "http://piranhacms.org/assets/twitter-shield.png";

        /// <summary>
        /// Initializes the module.
        /// </summary>
        public void Init()
        {
            App.Blocks.Register<Blocks.HeaderBlock>();
        }
    }
}
~~~

##### SimpleModuleExtensions.cs

~~~ csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders;
using Piranha;
using SimpleModule;

public static class SimpleModuleExtensions
{
    public static IServiceCollection AddSimpleModule(this IServiceCollection services)
    {
        App.Modules.Register<Module>();

        return services;
    }

    public static IApplicationBuilder UseSimpleModule(this IApplicationBuilder builder)
    {
        // Manager resources
        App.Modules.Manager().Scripts
           .Add("~/manager/simplemodule/js/header-block.js");

        // Add the embedded resources
        return builder.UseStaticFiles(new StaticFileOptions
        {
            FileProvider = new EmbeddedFileProvider(typeof(SimpleModuleExtensions).Assembly,
                "SimpleModule.assets.dist"),
            RequestPath = "/manager/simplemodule"
        });
    }
}
~~~

## Using The Module

To use the module in our application all we have to do is to call the extensions methods in the correct place in our `Startup.cs`.

##### Startup.cs

~~~ csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    ...

    services.AddSimpleModule();

    ...
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, IApi api)
{
    ...

    app.UseSimpleModule();

    ...
}
~~~

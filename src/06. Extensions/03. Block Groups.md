# Block Groups

> This article covers how to implement custom block groups for Piranha. If you want to read more about the standard blocks included, please refer to [Blocks](../content/blocks) in the section **Content**.

A Block Group is a special kind of block that can have child items. Just like regular blocks, block groups can have Field Properties defined. These fields are **global** for the group and are displayed above the actual items.

Please note that block groups **can not** contain other block groups as items, so they can't be used to build a recursive structure.

## Creating a Block Group

The main difference between creating a custom block and a block group is that they inherit from different base classes and uses different attributes for their meta data. All block groups must inherit from the base class `Piranha.Extend.BlockGroup`.

As an example, let's take a look how the **Gallery** block group is implemented.

~~~ csharp
using Piranha.Extend;
using Piranha.Extend.Fields;

[BlockGroupType(Name = "Gallery", Category = "Media", Icon = "fas fa-images")]
[BlockItemType(Type = typeof(ImageBlock))]
public class ImageGalleryBlock : BlockGroup
{
}
~~~

### Block Group Configuration

In order to register your block group you need to mark it with the `BlockGroupType` attribute like in the above example. This attribute has the following properties:

##### Name

~~~ csharp
public string Name { get; set; }
~~~

This is the name that is shown in the manager interface when editing.

##### Category

~~~ csharp
public string Category { get; set; }
~~~

The name of category the block group will be grouped under in the manager interface.

##### Icon

~~~ csharp
public string Icon { get; set; }
~~~

Css class for redering the block group icon in the manager interface. The manager interface uses the free icon package from **font awesome**.

##### Display

~~~ csharp
public BlockDisplayMode Display { get; set; }
~~~

Determines how the group should be rendered in the manager interface. The available options are:

* **MasterDetail** - Displays the group with an item list to the left and the selected item to the right.
* **Horizontal** - Displays the group items in a horizontal columns.
* **Vertical** - Displays the group items in a vertical list.

The default setting for this property is **MasterDetail**

### Limiting Child Item Types

If you want you can limit the types of blocks that can be positioned within your group. This is done by adding **one or several** `BlockItemType` attributes to you class. As an example, the Image Gallery above only accepts child items of the type `ImageBlock`.

##### Type

~~~ csharp
public Type Type { get; set; }
~~~

The item type of the block that should be allowed inside the group.

### Global Fields

If you want your block group to have global fields you just add them to your block group class. Let's for example say that we'd like to add a title for our entire image gallery:

~~~ csharp
using Piranha.Extend;
using Piranha.Extend.Fields;

[BlockGroupType(Name = "Gallery", Category = "Media", Icon = "fas fa-images")]
[BlockItemType(Type = typeof(ImageBlock))]
public class ImageGalleryBlock : BlockGroup
{
    public StringField Title { get; set; }
}
~~~

## Register The Block Group

Block groups are registered in the same way as regular blocks. For more information, please read the article about [Blocks](blocks).

## Create The Manager Component

No specific `Vue` component is needed to render block groups.

# Prerequisites

> Piranha is built on `.NET 6` which is a free, open source, cross platform version of `.NET` provided by Microsoft. You can find more information about `.NET` [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com).

## Installing .NET Core

You can download the `.NET Core SDK` from [dotnet.microsoft.com](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) for Windows, Linux and MacOS. Make sure to get the latest version of the SDK for version `6`.

## Choosing An Editor

Personally we love [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) which is a lightweight, cross platform editor with excellent extensions for `.NET` and `Azure`, but you can use any editor you want. If you want a more complete IDE, [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) is also free and available for Windows and MacOS.

## Installing Piranha

We recommend you to install our project templates which will help you get started quickly on a new project. All of our available templates are bundled into a single package, so installation is quick and simple. Just type the following into the command line.

~~~ bash
dotnet new -i Piranha.Templates
~~~

You can read more about the different project templates we provide [here](project-templates).

## Running Piranha under IIS

When running Piranha under IIS, take care that the `WebDAVModule` is disabled. Some hosting providers have it enabled by default. If enabled, you may experience problems with API calls in the `Manager`, because e.g. `PUT` and `DELETE`request interfere with the `WebDAVModule`. You can switch it off with the following entries in `web.config`:
```Xml
<system.webServer>
	<modules>
		<remove name="WebDAVModule" />
	</modules>
	<handlers>
		<remove name="WebDAV" />
	</handlers>
</system.webServer>
```

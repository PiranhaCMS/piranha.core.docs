# Prerequisites

> Piranha is built on `.NET 8` which is a free, open source, cross platform version of `.NET` provided by Microsoft. You can find more information about `.NET` [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com).

## Installing .NET

You can download the `.NET SDK` from [dotnet.microsoft.com](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) for Windows, Linux and MacOS. Make sure to get the latest version of the SDK for version `8`.

## Choosing An Editor

Personally we love [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) which is a lightweight, cross platform editor with excellent extensions for `.NET` and `Azure`, but you can use any editor you want. If you want a more complete IDE, [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) is also free and available for Windows and MacOS.

## Installing Piranha

We recommend you to install our project templates which will help you get started quickly on a new project. All of our available templates are bundled into a single package, so installation is quick and simple. Just type the following into the command line.

~~~ bash
dotnet new -i Piranha.Templates
~~~

You can read more about the different project templates we provide [here](project-templates).
